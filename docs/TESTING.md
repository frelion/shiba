`test-l0.sh` selects the matching `pg17` or `pg18` feature, then runs formatting,
Protocol/Catalog/Runtime checks and tests, clippy with warnings denied, `git diff
--check`, forbidden-surface scans, the canonical fixture byte/digest check, and
the deferred-evidence manifest completeness check.

Each `test-empty-install.sh` invocation creates an isolated empty cluster. It
proves complete rollback after a forced failure in the `CREATE EXTENSION`
transaction; successful install and the single `1|1` version result; public API
access and private table denial for an ordinary role; and clean extension drop.
This re-proves only the Phase-1 installation rollback boundary, not later
component recovery.

`test-m2.sh` creates another isolated cluster and packages the extension. Its
test-only source schema commits two ordinary rows before constructing the Rust
input. It proves result `2`, cross-schema placement, exact replay, identity
conflict, operator-error rollback, backend-termination rollback after the
continuation write, reconnect/replay, and ordinary-role result-only access.
Failure triggers are test objects and never ship in extension SQL.

`test-m3.sh` enables logical decoding in an isolated cluster, creates one
test-only publication and `pgoutput` slot, and captures two real committed
transactions. The integration test removes only that client's per-XLogData
delimiter, decodes pure pgoutput, applies through M2, and proves result `2`,
exact replay `2`, and corrupt/truncated input state unchanged. For the second
transaction it disables periodic feedback, stops the receiver after complete
COMMIT, applies result `3` while `confirmed_flush_lsn` is unchanged, kills the
receiver, then proves slot replay is the identical transaction and is a no-op.
PG17 and PG18 run the same gate.

`test-m4.sh` captures a real two-column relation containing SQL NULL and an
`int8` value. It proves operator-error rollback after payload Apply, exact Apply
facts, count result, replay no-op, and a precisely corrupted key tuple tag
failing before any durable state appears.

`test-m4-empty.sh` captures two zero-column INSERTs committed together. It
proves two NULL-key/absent-payload Apply facts, count `2`, replay no-op, and a
corrupt nonzero tuple column count failing with zero durable state.

`test-m4-composite.sh` captures two rows sharing key-1 but differing in key-2.
It proves exact two-part Apply facts, count `2`, replay no-op, and a precisely
corrupted second-key tag failing with zero durable state.

`test-m4-update.sh` applies a real INSERT and then captures an unchanged-key
UPDATE whose nullable payload becomes SQL NULL. It proves count stays `1`, the
Apply payload changes exactly once, a corrupt key tag fails before writes, and
backend termination after continuation INSERT rolls payload and continuation
back together before a successful retry and replay no-op.

During development run fmt, check, the Runtime unit tests, one current scenario,
and clippy. Run both complete PG matrices only at the milestone boundary.

## Evidence handling

Fixtures in `tests/fixtures` must be data, not copied executable implementation.
The canonical Protocol vector has the adjacent
`tests/fixtures/protocol/canonical-v1.provenance.md`, including source, legacy
commit, old command, and clean-room command. It has been re-proved. The
`tests/fixtures/pg/deferred-evidence.json` file is only an A-class evidence
index: legacy scenarios remain provenance until reproduced case by case. M2's
independent rollback/crash tests do not claim equivalence to an old runtime.
Differential tests use the legacy
repository solely as an oracle and must never link it, load its SQL, or share a
catalog authority.
